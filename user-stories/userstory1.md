# gigify user story 1

---

1.  As an artist looking to book gigs, I need to be able to look at a venue and see when I might be able to play and submit my information for consideration for the gig.

    - A user can see a list of local venues, select one and:
      - See available dates that can be booked
      - Select a date
      - input my information and media for consideration by the venue
